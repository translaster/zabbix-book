# Welcome

This book is born from a simple desire: **to give back**. After years of
working with Zabbix, and authoring previous many other publications about the platform,
Patrik and Nathan felt a strong pull to share their knowledge in a way that was accessible
to everyone. That's how the initial idea of a free, online Zabbix resource was
conceived – **a community-driven project dedicated to empowering users**.

As the online resource grew, so did the vision. We recognized the potential to create
something even more impactful. This led to the formation of a foundation, dedicated
to ensuring the long-term sustainability and growth of this community effort.
This book, a tangible culmination of that vision, represents the next step. All
profits generated from its sales will be reinvested back into the community, enabling
us to further expand and enhance the resources and support we offer. This is more
than just a book; it's a testament to the power of shared knowledge and a commitment
to fostering a thriving Zabbix community."
