# Basic installation

In this chapter, we will walk through the process of installing the Zabbix server.
There are many different ways to setup a Zabbix server. We will cover the most
common setups with MariaDB and PostgreSQL on Ubuntu and on Rocky Linux.

Before beginning the installation, it is important to understand the architecture
of Zabbix.
The Zabbix server is structured in a modular fashion, composed of three main components,
which we will discuss in detail.

* The Zabbix server
* The Zabbix web server
* The Zabbix database

![overview](./basic-installation/zabbix-server.png){ align=left }
*1.1 Zabbix basic split installation*

All of these components can either be installed on a single server or distributed
across three separate servers. The core of the system is the Zabbix server, often
referred to as the "brain." This component is responsible for processing trigger
calculations and sending alerts. The database serves as the storage for the Zabbix
server's configuration and all the data it collects. The web server provides the
user interface (front-end) for interacting with the system. It is important to note
that the Zabbix API is part of the front-end component, not the Zabbix server itself.

These components must function together seamlessly, as illustrated in the diagram
above. The Zabbix server must read configurations and store monitoring data in the
database, while the front-end needs access to read and write configuration data.
Furthermore, the front-end must be able to check the status of the Zabbix server
and retrieve additional necessary information to ensure smooth operation.

For our setup, we will be using two virtual machines (VMs): one VM will host both
the Zabbix server and the Zabbix web front-end, while the second VM will host the
Zabbix database.

???+ note

    It's perfect possible to install all components on 1 single VM or every component
    on a separate VM.
    Reason we split the DB as an example is because the database will probably be the
    first component giving you performance headaches. It's also the component that
    needs some extra attention when we split it so for this reason we have chosen
    in this example to split the database from the rest of the setup.

We will cover the following topics:

* Install our Database based on MariaDB.
* Install our Database based on PostgreSQL.
* Installing the Zabbix server.
* Install the frontend.

## Installing the MariaDB database

To begin the installation process for the MariaDB server, the first step involves
manually creating a repository configuration file. This file, mariadb.repo on Rocky,
must be placed in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. The repository file will allow
your package manager to locate and install the necessary MariaDB components.
For Ubuntu we need to import the repository keys and create a file for example
'/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mariadb.sources'.

### Add the MariaDB repository

To create the MariaDB repository file, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
RedHat
# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/mariadb.repo

Ubuntu
# sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https curl
# sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
#sudo curl -o /etc/apt/keyrings/mariadb-keyring.pgp 'https://mariadb.org/mariadb_release_signing_key.pgp'

# sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mariadb.sources
```

This will open a text editor where you can input the repository configuration details.
Once the repository is configured, you can proceed with the installation of MariaDB
using your package manager.

???+ tip
    Always check Zabbix documentation for the latest supported versions.

The latest config can be found here:
https://mariadb.org/download/?t=repo-config

Here's the configuration you need to add into the file:

RedHat
```bash
# MariaDB 11.4 RedHatEnterpriseLinux repository list - created 2025-02-21 10:15 UTC
# https://mariadb.org/download/
[mariadb]
name = MariaDB
# rpm.mariadb.org is a dynamic mirror if your preferred mirror goes offline. See https://mariadb.org/mirrorbits/ for details.
# baseurl = https://rpm.mariadb.org/11.4/rhel/$releasever/$basearch

gpgkey = https://mirror.bouwhuis.network/mariadb/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB
gpgcheck = 1
```
Ubuntu
```bash

URIs: https://mirror.bouwhuis.network/mariadb/repo/11.4/ubuntu
Suites: noble
Components: main main/debug
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/mariadb-keyring.pgp
```

After saving the file, ensure that everything is properly set up and that your
MariaDB version is compatible with your Zabbix version to avoid potential
integration issues.

Before proceeding with the MariaDB installation, it's a best practice to ensure
your operating system is up-to-date with the latest patches and security fixes.
This will help maintain system stability and compatibility with the software you're
about to install.

To update your OS, run the following command:

RedHat
```bash
# dnf update -y
```
Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get update
```

This command will automatically fetch and install the latest updates available for
your system, applying security patches, performance improvements, and bug fixes.
Once the update process is complete, you can move forward with the MariaDB installation.

### Install the MariaDB database

With the operating system updated and the MariaDB repository configured, you are
now ready to install the MariaDB server and client packages. This will provide the
necessary components to run and manage your database.

To install the MariaDB server and client, execute the following command:

```bash
RedHat
# dnf install MariaDB-server MariaDB-client

Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install mariadb-server
```

This command will download and install both the server and client packages, enabling
you to set up, configure, and interact with your MariaDB database. Once the
installation is complete, you can proceed to start and configure the MariaDB service.

Now that MariaDB is installed, we need to enable the service to start automatically
upon boot and start it immediately. Use the following command to accomplish this:

```bash
RedHat
# systemctl enable mariadb --now
```

This command will both enable and start the MariaDB service. Once the service is
running, you can verify that the installation was successful by checking the
version of MariaDB using the following command:

```bash
RedHat and Ubuntu
# mariadb -V
```

The expected output should resemble this:

```
mariadb from 11.4.5-MariaDB, client 15.2 for Linux (aarch64) using  EditLine wrapper
```

To ensure that the MariaDB service is running properly, you can check its status
with the following command:

```bash
RedHat and Ubuntu
# systemctl status mariadb
```

You should see an output similar to this, indicating that the MariaDB service
is active and running:

```bash

This confirms that your MariaDB server is up and running, ready for further configuration.

### Securing the MariaDB Database

To enhance the security of your MariaDB server, it's essential to remove unnecessary
test databases, anonymous users, and set a root password. This can be done using the
mariadb-secure-installation script, which provides a step-by-step guide to securing
your database.

Run the following command:

```bash
RedHat and Ubuntu
# sudo mariadb-secure-installation
```

```
NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user. If you've just installed MariaDB, and
haven't set the root password yet, you should just press enter here.

Enter current password for root (enter for none):
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Setting the root password or using the unix_socket ensures that nobody
can log into the MariaDB root user without the proper authorisation.

You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'.

Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] n
 ... skipping.

You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'.

Change the root password? [Y/n] y
New password:
Re-enter new password:
Password updated successfully!
Reloading privilege tables..
 ... Success!


By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
 - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

Cleaning up...

All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
installation should now be secure.

Thanks for using MariaDB!
```

The mariadb-secure-installation script will guide you through several key steps:

1. Set a root password if one isn't already set.
2. Remove anonymous users.
3. Disallow remote root logins.
4. Remove the test database.
5. Reload the privilege tables to ensure the changes take effect.

Once complete, your MariaDB instance will be significantly more secure. You are
now ready to configure the database for Zabbix.

### Create the Zabbix database

With MariaDB now set up and secured, we can move on to creating the database for
Zabbix. This database will store all the necessary data related to your Zabbix server,
including configuration information and monitoring data.

Follow these steps to create the Zabbix database:

Log in to the MariaDB shell as the root user:
You'll be prompted to enter the root password that you set during the mariadb-secure-installation
process.

```bash
RedHat and Ubuntu
# mariadb -uroot -p
```

Once you're logged into the MariaDB shell, run the following command to create a
database for Zabbix:

```bash
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE zabbix CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
```

???+ note
    utf8mb4 is a proper implementation of UTF-8 in MySQL/MariaDB, supporting all
    Unicode characters, including emojis. The older utf8 charset in MySQL/MariaDB
    only supports up to three bytes per character and is not a true UTF-8 implementation,
    which is why utf8mb4 is recommended.

This command creates a new database named zabbix with the UTF-8 character set,
which is required for Zabbix.

Create a dedicated user for Zabbix and grant the necessary privileges: Next, you
need to create a user that Zabbix will use to access the database. Replace password
with a strong password of your choice.

```sql
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'zabbix-web'@'<zabbix server ip>' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'zabbix-srv'@'<zabbix server ip>' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON zabbix.* TO 'zabbix-srv'@'<zabbix server ip>';
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT ON zabbix.* TO 'zabbix-web'@'<zabbix server ip>';
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

This creates new users for zabbix-web and zabbix-srv, grants them access to the
zabbix database, and ensures that the privileges are applied immediately.

In some cases, especially when setting up Zabbix with MariaDB, you might encounter
issues related to stored functions and triggers if binary logging is enabled.
To address this, you need to set the log_bin_trust_function_creators option to 1
in the MariaDB configuration file. This allows non-root users to create stored
functions and triggers without requiring SUPER privileges, which are restricted
when binary logging is enabled.

```sql
MariaDB [(none)]> SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
MariaDB [(none)]> QUIT
```

At this point, your Zabbix database is ready, and you can proceed with configuring
the Zabbix server to connect to the database.

???+ warning
    In the Zabbix documentation, it is explicitly stated that deterministic
    triggers need to be created during the schema import. On MySQL and MariaDB
    systems, this requires setting GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1
    if binary logging is enabled, and you lack superuser privileges.

    If the log_bin_trust_function_creators option is not set in the MySQL
    configuration file, it will block the creation of these triggers during
    schema import. This is essential because, without superuser access,
    non-root users cannot create triggers or stored functions unless this setting is applied.

    To summarize:

    - Binary logging enabled: If binary logging is enabled and the user does not
      have superuser privileges, the creation of necessary Zabbix triggers will
      fail unless log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1 is set.

    - Solution: Add log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1 to the [mysqld] section
      in your MySQL/MariaDB configuration file or temporarily set it at runtime
      with SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1 if you have sufficient
      permissions.

    This ensures that Zabbix can successfully create the required triggers during
    schema import without encountering privilege-related errors.

If we want our Zabbix server to connect to our DB then we also need to open our firewall port.

RedHat
```
# firewall-cmd --add-port=3306/tcp --permanent
# firewall-cmd --reload
```
Ubuntu
```
# sudo ufw allow 10051/tcp
```

### Populate the Zabbix DB

With the users and permissions set up correctly, you can now populate the database
with the Zabbix schema created and other required elements. Follow these steps:

One of the first things we need to do is add the Zabbix repository to our machine.
This may sound weird but actually makes sense because we need to populate our DB
with our Zabbix schemas.

RedHat
```bash
# rpm -Uvh https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/7.2/release/rocky/9/noarch/zabbix-release-latest-7.2.el9.noarch.rpm
# dnf clean all
# dnf install zabbix-sql-scripts -y
```

Ubuntu
```bash
# wget https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/7.2/release/ubuntu/pool/main/z/zabbix-release/zabbix-release_latest_7.2+ubuntu24.04_all.deb
# dpkg -i zabbix-release_latest_7.2+ubuntu24.04_all.deb
# apt update
# apt install zabbix-sql-scripts
```
Now lets upload the data from zabbix (db structure, images, user, ... )
for this we make use of the user `zabbix-srv` and we upload it all in our DB `zabbix`.

RedHat and Ubuntu
```bash
# sudo zcat /usr/share/zabbix/sql-scripts/mysql/server.sql.gz | mariadb --default-character-set=utf8mb4 -uzabbix-srv -p zabbix
```
???+ note
    Depending on the speed of your hardware or virtual machine, the process may
    take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Please be patient and
    avoid cancelling the operation; just wait for the prompt to appear.

Log back into your MySQL Database as root

```bash
# mariadb -uroot -p
```
Once the import of the Zabbix schema is complete and you no longer need the
log_bin_trust_function_creators global parameter, it is a good practice to remove
it for security reasons.

To revert the change and set the global parameter back to 0, use the following
command in the MariaDB shell:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 0;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.001 sec)
```
This command will disable the setting, ensuring that the servers security
posture remains robust.

This concludes our installation of the MariaDB


## Installing the PostgreSQL database

For our DB setup with PostgreSQL we need to add our PostgreSQL repository first
to the system. As of writing PostgreSQL 13-17 are supported but best is to have
a look before you install it as new versions may be supported and older maybe
unsupported both by Zabbix and PostgreSQL. Usually it's a good idea to go with
the latest version that is supported by Zabbix. Zabbix also supports the extension
TimescaleDB this is something we will talk later about. As you will see the setup
from PostgreSQL is very different from MySQL not only the installation but
also securing the DB.

The table of compatibility can be found [https://docs.timescale.com/self-hosted/latest/upgrades/upgrade-pg/](https://docs.timescale.com/self-hosted/latest/upgrades/upgrade-pg/)


### Add the PostgreSQL repository

So let us start first setting up our PostgreSQL repository with the following commands.

RedHat
```bash
Install the repository RPM:
# sudo dnf install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-9-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
# sudo dnf -qy module disable postgresql
```

### Install the PostgreSQL databases

RedHat

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL:
sudo dnf install -y postgresql17-server

Initialize the database and enable automatic start:
# sudo /usr/pgsql-17/bin/postgresql-17-setup initdb
# sudo systemctl enable postgresql-17 --now
```
Ubuntu
```

todo
```

### Securing the PostgreSQL database

PostgreSQL handles access permissions differently from MySQL and MariaDB.
PostgreSQL relies on a file called pg_hba.conf to manage who can access the database,
from where, and what encryption method is used for authentication.

???+ note
    Client authentication in PostgreSQL is configured through the pg_hba.conf
    file, where "HBA" stands for Host-Based Authentication. This file specifies
    which users can access the database, from which hosts, and how they are authenticated.
    For further details, you can refer to the official PostgreSQL documentation."
    [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html)


Add the following lines, the order here is important.

```bash
Redhat

# vi /var/lib/pgsql/17/data/pg_hba.conf

Ubuntu

Todo
```

The result should look like : 
```
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local    zabbix     zabbix-srv                                                              scram-sha-256
local    all            all                                                                            peer
# IPv4 local connections
host     zabbix     zabbix-srv          <ip from zabbix server/24>     scram-sha-256
host     zabbix     zabbix-web        <ip from zabbix server/24>     scram-sha-256
host     all            all                         127.0.0.1/32                            scram-sha-256
```

After we changed the pg_hba file don't forget to restart postgres else the settings
will not be applied. But before we restart let us also edit the file postgresql.conf
and allow our database to listen on our network interface for incoming connections
from the zabbix server. Postgresql will standard only allow connections from the socket.

RedHat
```bash
# vi /var/lib/pgsql/17/data/postgresql.conf
```
Ubuntu
```bash

todo
```

To configure PostgreSQL to listen on all network interfaces, you need to modify
the `postgresql.conf` file. Locate the following line:

```bash
#listen_addresses = 'localhost'
```
and replace it with:
```
listen_addresses = '*'
```

This will enable PostgreSQL to accept connections from any network interface,
not just the local machine. After making this change, restart the PostgreSQL service
to apply the new settings:

```bash
Redhat
# systemctl restart postgresql-17

Ubuntu

todo
```
If the service fails to restart, review the pg_hba.conf file for any syntax errors,
as incorrect entries here may prevent PostgreSQL from starting.

Next, to prepare your PostgreSQL instance for Zabbix, you'll need to create the
necessary database tables. Begin by installing the Zabbix repository, as you did
for the Zabbix server. Then, install the appropriate Zabbix package that contains
the predefined tables, images, icons, and other database elements needed for the
Zabbix application.

### Create the Zabbix database

To begin, add the Zabbix repository to your system by running the following commands:

```bash
RedHat
# dnf install https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/7.2/release/rocky/9/noarch/zabbix-release-latest-7.2.el9.noarch.rpm -y
# dnf install zabbix-sql-scripts -y 

Ubuntu

todo
```
With the necessary packages installed, you are now ready to create the Zabbix users for both the server and frontend.

First, switch to the `postgres` user and create the Zabbix server database user:

```
# su - postgres
# createuser --pwprompt zabbix-srv
Enter password for new role: <server-password>
Enter it again: <server-password>
```
Next, create the Zabbix frontend user, which will be used to connect to the database:

```
# createuser --pwprompt zabbix-web
Enter password for new role: <frontend-password>
Enter it again: <frontend-password>
```

After creating the users, you need to prepare the database schema. As the root
user, unzip the necessary schema files by running the following command:

```bash
RedHat
# gzip -d /usr/share/zabbix/sql-scripts/postgresql/server.sql.gz

Ubuntu

todo
```

???+ note
    Zabbix seems to like to change the locations of the script to populate the
    DB every version or in between versions. If you encounter an error take a
    look at the Zabbix documentation there is a good chance that some location was changed.

This will extract the database schema required for the Zabbix server.

Now that the users are created, the next step is to create the Zabbix database. 
First, switch to the `postgres` user and execute the following command to create
the database with the owner set to zabbix-srv:

```bash
RedHat
# su - postgres
# createdb -E Unicode -O zabbix-srv zabbix
# exit

Ubuntu

Todo
```
Once the database is created, you should verify the connection and ensure that
the correct user session is active. To do this, log into the zabbix database using
the zabbix-srv user:

```
# psql -d zabbix -U zabbix-srv
```

After logging in, run the following SQL query to confirm that both the `session_user`
and `current_user` are set to `zabbix-srv`:

```
zabbix=> SELECT session_user, current_user;
 session_user | current_user
--------------+--------------
 zabbix-srv   | zabbix-srv
(1 row)
```
If the output matches, you are successfully connected to the database with the correct user.

PostgreSQL indeed differs significantly from MySQL or MariaDB in several aspects,
and one of the key features that sets it apart is its use of schemas. Unlike MySQL,
where databases are more standalone, PostgreSQL's schema system provides a structured,
multi-user environment within a single database.

Schemas act as logical containers within a database, enabling multiple users or
applications to access and manage data independently without conflicts. This feature
is especially valuable in environments where several users or applications need to
interact with the same database concurrently. Each user or application can have
its own schema, preventing accidental interference with each other's data.

???+ note
    PostgreSQL comes with a default schema, typically called public, but it's in
    general best practice to create custom schemas to better organize and separate
    database objects, especially in complex or multi-user environments.

    For more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the detailed guide at
    this URI, [https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-schema/#schema](https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-schema/#schema)
    which explains the benefits and use cases for schemas in PostgreSQL.

To finalize the database setup for Zabbix, we need to configure schema permissions
for both the `zabbix-srv` and `zabbix-web` users.

First, we create a custom schema named `zabbix_server` and assign ownership to
the `zabbix-srv` user:

```
zabbix=> CREATE SCHEMA zabbix_server AUTHORIZATION "zabbix-srv";
CREATE SCHEMA
```
Next, we set the `search path` to `zabbix_server` schema so that it's the default
for the current session:

```
zabbix=> SET search_path TO "zabbix_server";
```

To confirm the schema setup, you can list the existing schemas:

```
zabbix=> \dn
          List of schemas
     Name      |       Owner
---------------+-------------------
 public        | pg_database_owner
 zabbix_server | zabbix-srv
(2 rows)
```

At this point, the `zabbix-srv` user has full access to the schema, but the `zabbix-web`
user still needs appropriate permissions to connect and interact with the database.
First, we grant `USAGE` privileges on the schema to allow `zabbix-web` to connect:

```
zabbix=# GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA zabbix_server TO "zabbix-web";
GRANT
```

However, `zabbix-web` still cannot perform any operations on the tables or sequences.
To allow basic data interaction without giving too many privileges, grant the
following permissions:

- For tables: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
- For sequences: SELECT and UPDATE.

```
zabbix=# GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA zabbix_server TO "zabbix-web";
grant
```
```
zabbix=# GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA zabbix_server TO "zabbix-web";
GRANT
```
### Populate the Zabbix DB

Now, the `zabbix-web` user has appropriate access to interact with the schema
while maintaining security by limiting permissions to essential operations.

With the users and permissions set up correctly, you can now populate the database
with the Zabbix schema created and other required elements. Follow these steps:

- Execute the SQL file to populate the database. Run the following command in the `psql` shell:

???+ warning
    Make sure you did previous steps carefully so that you have selected the correct search_path.
```
sql zabbix=# \i /usr/share/zabbix/sql-scripts/postgresql/server.sql
```

???+ warning
    Depending on your hardware or VM performance, this process can take anywhere
    from a few seconds to several minutes. Please be patient and avoid cancelling the operation.

- Monitor the progress as the script runs. You will see output similar to:

```sql
zabbix=> \i /usr/share/zabbix/sql-scripts/postgresql/server.sql
CREATE TABLE
CREATE INDEX
CREATE TABLE
CREATE INDEX
CREATE TABLE
...
...
...
INSERT 0 10444
DELETE 90352
COMMIT
```

Once the script completes and you return to the `zabbix=#` prompt, the database
should be successfully populated with all the required tables, schemas,
images, and other elements needed for Zabbix.

???+ note
    If you encounter the following error during the SQL import: 
    `vbnet psql:/usr/share/zabbix/sql-scripts/postgresql/server.sql:7: ERROR: no
    schema has been selected to create in` It indicates that the search_path setting
    might not have been correctly applied. This setting is crucial because it specifies
    the schema where the tables and other objects should be created. By correctly
    setting the search path, you ensure that the SQL script will create tables
    and other objects in the intended schema.

To ensure that the Zabbix tables were created successfully and have the correct
permissions, you can verify the table list and their ownership using the `psql` command:

- List the Tables: Use the following command to list all tables in the `zabbix_server` schema:

```
sql zabbix=# \dt
```

You should see a list of tables with their schema, name, type, and owner.
For example:

```sql
zabbix=> \dt
                        List of relations
    Schema     |            Name            | Type  |   Owner
---------------+----------------------------+-------+------------
 zabbix_server | acknowledges               | table | zabbix-srv
 zabbix_server | actions                    | table | zabbix-srv
 zabbix_server | alerts                     | table | zabbix-srv
 zabbix_server | auditlog                   | table | zabbix-srv
 zabbix_server | autoreg_host               | table | zabbix-srv
 zabbix_server | changelog                  | table | zabbix-srv
 zabbix_server | conditions                 | table | zabbix-srv
...
...
...
 zabbix_server | valuemap                   | table | zabbix-srv
 zabbix_server | valuemap_mapping           | table | zabbix-srv
 zabbix_server | widget                     | table | zabbix-srv
 zabbix_server | widget_field               | table | zabbix-srv
(203 rows)
```
- Verify Permissions: Confirm that the zabbix-srv user owns the tables and has
the necessary permissions. You can check permissions for specific tables using
the \dp command:

```sql
sql zabbix=# \dp zabbix_server.*
```

This will display the access privileges for all tables in the `zabbix_server`
schema. Ensure that `zabbix-srv` has the required privileges.

If everything looks correct, your tables are properly created and the `zabbix-srv`
user has the appropriate ownership and permissions. If you need to adjust any
permissions, you can do so using the GRANT commands as needed.

???+ note
    If you prefer not to set the search path manually each time you log in as the
    `zabbix-srv` user, you can configure PostgreSQL to automatically use the desired
    search path. Run the following SQL command to set the default search path for
    the `zabbix-srv` role:

    sql zabbix=> ALTER ROLE "zabbix-srv" SET search_path = "$user", public, zabbix_server;

    This command ensures that every time the `zabbix-srv` user connects to the
    database, the `search_path` is automatically set to include `$user`, `public`, and `zabbix_server`.

If you are ready you can exit the database and return as user root.

```
zabbix=> \q
```


## Installing the Zabbix server


Before proceeding with the installation of your Zabbix server, ensure that the server
is properly configured, as outlined in the previous section [System Requirements](../ch00-getting-started/Requirements.md)

Another critical step at this stage if you use RedHat based systems is disabling
SELinux, which can interfere with the installation and operation of Zabbix.
We will revisit SELinux at the end of this chapter once our installation is finished.

To check the current status of SELinux, you can use the following command: `sestatus``


```
# sestatus
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   enforcing
Mode from config file:          enforcing
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Memory protection checking:     actual (secure)
Max kernel policy version:      33
```
As shown, the system is currently in enforcing mode. To temporarily disable SELinux,
you can run the following command: `setenforce 0`


```
# setenforce 0
# sestatus

SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   permissive
Mode from config file:          enforcing
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Memory protection checking:     actual (secure)
Max kernel policy version:      33
```
Now, as you can see, the mode is switched to permissive. However, this change
is not persistent across reboots. To make it permanent, you need to modify the
SELinux configuration file located at `/etc/selinux/config`. Open the file and
replace enforcing with `permissive`.

Alternatively, you can achieve the same result more easily by running the
following command:

RedHat
```
# sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/g' /etc/selinux/config
```
This line will alter the configuration file for you. So when we run `sestatus`
again we will see that we are in `permissive` mode and that our configuration
file is also in permissive mode.

```
# sestatus

SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   permissive
Mode from config file:          permissive
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Memory protection checking:     actual (secure)
Max kernel policy version:      33
```

### Adding the Zabbix repository

From the Zabbix Download page [https://www.zabbix.com/download](https://www.zabbix.com/download),
select the appropriate Zabbix version you wish to install. In this case, we will
be using Zabbix 8.0 LTS. Additionally, ensure you choose the correct OS distribution
for your environment, which will be Rocky Linux 9 or Ubuntu 24.04 in our case.

We will be installing the Zabbix Server along with NGINX as the web server for
the front-end. Make sure to download the relevant packages for your chosen configuration.

![ch1-zabbix-download.png](basic-installation/ch1-zabbix-download.png)

If you make use of a RHEL based system like Rocky then the first step is to disable
the Zabbix packages provided by the EPEL repository, if it's installed on your system.
To do this, edit the `/etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo` file and add the following statement
to disable the EPEL repository by default:

RedHat
```
[epel]
...
excludepkgs=zabbix*
```

???+ tip
    It's considered bad practice to keep the EPEL repository enabled all the time,
    as it may cause conflicts by unintentionally overwriting or installing unwanted
    packages. Instead, it's safer to enable the repository only when needed, by using
    the following command during installations: dnf install --enablerepo=epel <package-name>
    This ensures that EPEL is only enabled when explicitly required.

Next, we will install the Zabbix repository on our operating system. After adding
the Zabbix repository, it is recommended to perform a repository cleanup to remove
old cache files and ensure the repository metadata is up to date. You can do this
by running:

RedHat
```
# rpm -Uvh https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/7.2/release/rocky/9/noarch/zabbix-release-latest-7.2.el9.noarch.rpm
# dnf clean all
```
Ubuntu
```
# wget https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/7.2/release/ubuntu/pool/main/z/zabbix-release/zabbix-release_latest_7.2+ubuntu24.04_all.deb
# dpkg -i zabbix-release_latest_7.2+ubuntu24.04_all.deb
# apt update
```
This will refresh the repository metadata and prepare the system for Zabbix installation.

???+ note
    A repository in Linux is a configuration that allows you to access and install
    software packages. You can think of it like an "app store" where you find and
    download software from a trusted source, in this case, the Zabbix repository.
    Many repositories are available, but it's important to only add those you trust.
    The safest practice is to stick to the repositories provided by your operating 
    system and only add additional ones when you're sure they are both trusted and necessary.

    For our installation, the Zabbix repository is provided by the vendor itself,
    making it a trusted source. Another popular and safe repository for
    RedHat-based systems is EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux), which is
    commonly used in enterprise environments.
    However, always exercise caution when adding new repositories to ensure
    system security and stability.

### Installing the Zabbix server for MySQL/MariaDB

Now that we've added the Zabbix repository with the necessary software, we are
ready to install both the Zabbix server and the web server. Keep in mind that the
web server doesn't need to be installed on the same machine as the Zabbix server;
they can be hosted on separate systems if desired.

To install the Zabbix server and the web server components for MySQL/MariaDB,
run the following command:

RedHat
```
# dnf install zabbix-server-mysql zabbix-web-mysql -y
```
Ubuntu
```
# apt install zabbix-server-mysql zabbix-frontend-php
```
After successfully installing the Zabbix server and frontend packages, we need to
configure the Zabbix server to connect to the database. This requires modifying the
Zabbix server configuration file. Open the `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf` file and
update the following lines to match your database configuration:

RedHat and Ubuntu

```
vi /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf
```
```
DBHost=<database-host>
DBName=<database-name>
DBUser=<database-user>
DBPassword=<database-password>
```
Replace <database-host>, <database-name>, <database-user>, and <database-password> with
the appropriate values for your setup. This ensures that the Zabbix server can communicate
with your database.

Ensure that there is no # (comment symbol) in front of the configuration parameters,
as Zabbix will treat lines beginning with # as comments, ignoring them during execution.
Additionally, double-check for duplicate configuration lines; if there are multiple
lines with the same parameter, Zabbix will use the value from the last occurrence.

For our setup, the configuration will look like this:

```
DBHost=<ip or dns of your MariaDB server>
DBName=zabbix
DBUser=zabbix-srv
DBPassword=<your super secret password>
DBPort=3306
```
In this example:

- DBHost refers to the host where your database is running (use localhost if it's on the same machine).
- DBName is the name of the Zabbix database.
- DBUser is the database user.
- DBPassword is the password for the database user.

Make sure the settings reflect your environment's database configuration.

???+ note
    The Zabbix server configuration file offers an option to include additional
    configuration files for custom parameters. For a production environment, it's
    often best to avoid altering the original configuration file directly. Instead,
    you can create and include a separate configuration file for any additional or
    modified parameters. This approach ensures that your original configuration
    file remains untouched, which is particularly useful when performing upgrades
    or managing configurations with tools like Ansible, Puppet, or SaltStack. 

To enable this feature, remove the # from the line:
```bash
# Include=/usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf.d/*.conf
```
Ensure the path `/usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf.d/` exists and
create a custom configuration file in this directory.
This file should be readable by the `zabbix` user. By doing so, you can add
or modify parameters without modifying the default configuration file,
making system management and upgrades smoother.

With the Zabbix server configuration updated to connect to your database, you
can now start and enable the Zabbix server service. Run the following command
to enable the Zabbix server and ensure it starts automatically on boot:

Redhat and Ubuntu
```bash
systemctl enable zabbix-server --now
```
This command will start the Zabbix server service immediately and configure it
to launch on system startup. To verify that the Zabbix server is running correctly,
check the log file for any messages. You can view the latest entries in the `Zabbix server`
log file using:

```bash
tail /var/log/zabbix/zabbix_server.log
```
Look for messages indicating that the server has started successfully. If there
are any issues, the log file will provide details to help with troubleshooting.

This concludes our chapter on installing and configuring the Zabbix server with Mariadb. 






## Installing the frontend
