# Getting started with the Zabbix installation

We begin this chapter with a **deep dive into the Zabbix frontend**, the central hub
where all monitoring and configuration tasks come together. Alongside the basic
introduction to navigating the frontend, this chapter also covers **user and group
setup**, focusing on creating a secure and efficient user management system.

We'll walk through setting up **internal authentication** with best practices for
security, including **dual-factor authentication**. For those needing advanced integration,
we'll explore options like **SAML, LDAP**, and other external authentication methods.

This chapter strikes a balance between a straightforward overview “this is the frontend”
and a more in depth look at the **advanced choices** you can make to enhance your system's
security and manageability. Whether you're just getting started or looking to implement
robust security measures, there's something here for everyone.

By the end, you'll be well equipped to navigate the Zabbix frontend with confidence
and set up a secure, scalable user management system tailored to your organization's needs.
