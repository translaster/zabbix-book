# Getting Started with Zabbix – Unlocking the Power of Monitoring

Welcome to the world of **Zabbix**, a powerful open-source monitoring solution
designed to give you comprehensive insights into your IT infrastructure.
Whether you're managing a small network or overseeing a large-scale enterprise
system, Zabbix provides the tools you need to monitor performance, detect issues,
and ensure the smooth operation of your services.

In this book, we focus on **Zabbix LTS 7.0**, the long-term support version that
ensures stability and reliability for your monitoring needs. We'll explore its
extensive feature set, including the newly introduced **reporting functionality**
and **built-in web monitoring** based on the Selenium driver, which allows for
sophisticated end-user experience monitoring through automated browser interactions.

Zabbix is more than just a simple monitoring tool. It offers a wide range of
features that allow you to:

- **Monitor diverse environments**: Track the performance and availability of
servers, virtual machines, network devices, databases, and applications.
- **Create dynamic visualizations**: Use dashboards, graphs, maps, and screens
to visualize data and get an overview of your system's health at a glance.
- **Set up complex alerting mechanisms**: Define triggers and actions that notify
you of potential issues before they become critical, using various channels
like email, SMS, and integrations with external services.
- **Automate monitoring tasks**: Leverage auto-discovery and auto-registration to
keep up with changing environments without manual intervention.
- **Customize and extend**: Build custom scripts, templates, and integrations to
tailor Zabbix to your specific needs.
